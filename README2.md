Insight 1
https://public.tableau.com/profile/mimansha.agrawal1091#!/vizhome/flightscancelled_15888509836140/Sheet1?publish=yes

From this map we may see where most cancellations happen in California (33,331) and Texas (32,612). West Virginia has the lowest cancellations with only 103. The results can be filtered according to the day by day basis  as well as day of the week.

The reason for choosing this plot is that in a map chart we may easily see the states as well as we may compare the cancellation count among various states with day wise filter or with  a week fiter.

Insight 2

From this dashboard we see that on Monday, Texas had the greatest cancellation number with 668. This dashboard might also be filtered according to day by day basis.

The reason for choosing the bar graph is that city wise we are plotting the graph showing the cancellation number day wise as well as a specific day of the week. The bar graph will be a  proper visual for this.


Insight 3
https://public.tableau.com/profile/mimansha.agrawal1091#!/vizhome/dashboard2_15888562896430/Dashboard2?publish=yes

From this dashboard we may infer that we are depicting three graphs. The first graph shows the Number of cancellations on a day to day basis as well as the day of the week. The bar graph shows the state versus cancelled flights. The graph showed that Texas has the highest rate of cancellation of flights. The third graph shows a heat map that depicts the city along with the flight number and its cancellations. It is observed that the most flight cancellation occured in Chicago. 

The reason for choosing Tree map is that it will clearly depict the statewise cancellation of a specific flight number with a good visual. Its arrangement of size of the boxes denoted which is greater.
